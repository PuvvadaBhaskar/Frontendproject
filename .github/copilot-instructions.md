## Repo summary

Small React app scaffolded for Vite. Entrypoints and important files:
- `index.html` — mounts `/src/main.jsx`.
- `src/main.jsx` — application bootstrap (empty placeholder in this repo; App is defined in `src/App.jsx`).
- `src/App.jsx` — top-level React component, currently renders `src/Homepage/LoginPage.jsx`.
- `src/Homepage/LoginPage.jsx` — simple login UI, stateful with React hooks and a local `handleLogin` that currently logs to console.
- `vite.config.js` — Vite + React plugin; `package.json` scripts use `vite` commands.

## Big-picture architecture notes

- This is a single-page React app built with Vite. There is no backend code in this repository. The app is client-only and currently small (one page/component).
- Components are colocated under `src/` and use plain CSS files next to components (e.g., `src/Homepage/LoginPage.css` is referenced but missing).
- ESLint is configured via `eslint.config.js` (ESLint modern config object with react hooks and vite refresh plugin). Follow its rules when adding files: enable JSX in `.jsx` files and prefer named exports for components.

## Common developer workflows (how to run, build, lint)

- Install dependencies (from repository root where `Frontendproject/package.json` is located):

```powershell
cd Frontendproject
npm install
```

- Start dev server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

- Build production assets:

```powershell
npm run build
```

- Preview the built production build locally:

```powershell
npm run preview
```

- Run ESLint (project root):

```powershell
npm run lint
```

Note: there is a top-level `package.json` one level above `Frontendproject/`. Use `Frontendproject/package.json` for project scripts; the top-level file only lists `react-router-dom` in dependencies and appears unused.

## Project-specific patterns and conventions

- File extensions: use `.jsx` for React components (project is configured as ES modules, see `package.json` type: `module`).
- Styling: components reference local CSS files (e.g., `LoginPage.jsx` -> `LoginPage.css`). If a component imports a CSS file that is missing, create it next to the component.
- State management: small components use React hooks (`useState`). The repo now includes basic routing using `react-router-dom` (see `src/App.jsx` and `src/Homepage/SignupPage.jsx`). If you add pages, register routes in `src/App.jsx`.
- Console-first placeholder behavior: Many handlers (e.g., `handleLogin`) log to console. When implementing real integration, replace console logs with API calls and error handling.

## Integration points and external dependencies

- Vite dev server + `@vitejs/plugin-react` is the primary build/runtime pipeline. See `vite.config.js`.
- React v19 is the app runtime (check `Frontendproject/package.json` for exact versions).
- `react-router-dom` is now a dependency in `Frontendproject/package.json` and a simple signup route was added at `/signup`. Use `BrowserRouter` in `src/App.jsx` and add `Route` entries for new pages.

## Files to edit when adding features

- Bootstrapping: `src/main.jsx` should import `App` and mount it; currently the file exists but is empty — ensure it contains the usual ReactDOM createRoot call.
- Add component styles alongside components (e.g., `src/Homepage/LoginPage.css`) to match existing import patterns.
- Update `src/App.jsx` to add routes or additional pages.

## Examples: how to implement a small change

- To wire the app bootstrap, add to `src/main.jsx` (example):

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import './index.css'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
```

- To add a guest login handler in `LoginPage.jsx`, replace the guest anchor with a button and implement navigation or state change instead of `href="#"`.

## Helpful file references

- `Frontendproject/package.json` — scripts and dependency versions
- `vite.config.js` — Vite + React plugin
- `eslint.config.js` — linting rules and JSX/ECMAScript config
- `src/App.jsx`, `src/main.jsx`, `src/Homepage/LoginPage.jsx` — main app flow and UI patterns

## What AI agents should avoid changing without human review

- Do not modify `eslint.config.js` or `vite.config.js` substantially unless adding library support — these changes impact the entire dev/build pipeline.
- Avoid adding or removing dependencies at the workspace root; prefer edits in `Frontendproject/package.json` and provide a brief rationale.

## Short checklist for small PRs generated by an AI

1. Run `npm run lint` and fix lint errors matching `eslint.config.js`.
2. Run `npm run dev` and verify the component renders in the browser at the dev server URL.
3. Ensure any imported CSS files exist next to components.
4. Keep commits small and explain the motivation in the commit message (e.g., "add missing main.jsx bootstrap").
